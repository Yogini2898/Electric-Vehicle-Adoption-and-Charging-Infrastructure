# Electric-Vehicle-Adoption-and-Charging-Infrastructure
Summary:
The objective of this project is to evaluate electric vehicle (EV) adoption in Washington State and assess whether the current charging infrastructure is keeping pace with this growth. Using two authoritative government datasets, the Electric Vehicle Population Data from the Washington State Department of Licensing and the Alternative Fueling Stations Database from the U.S. Department of Transportation, EV registrations and charging station availability were analyzed at the ZIP-code level. While the charging data covers the entire U.S., the focus on Washington allows for a detailed, localized comparison. King County was found to have the highest EV count, with cities like Seattle, Bellevue, and Redmond showing both high EV adoption and substantial infrastructure, aligning with correlation analysis results. Log-scaled visualizations were employed to address the wide differences in EV and charging counts, revealing underlying patterns that raw numbers obscure. To quantify infrastructure gaps, a normalized deficit score was developed, highlighting areas where EV growth is outpacing charging expansion. Interestingly, some locations were found to have more charging ports than EVs, indicating over-provision. Regression models were attempted but proved less informative due to data skewness and outliers, making correlation analysis a more reliable indicator. Overall, while major metropolitan areas demonstrate alignment between EV adoption and infrastructure, the distribution is uneven, emphasizing the need for proactive, data-driven planning to ensure that charging capacity anticipates future EV growth across the state.
